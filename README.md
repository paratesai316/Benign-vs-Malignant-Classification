# Benign-vs-Malignant-Classification
Breast cancer screening requires accurate distinction between benign and malignant lesions. This project uses cropped mammogram ROIs from the datasets to train deep learning models. Pretrained CNNs are fine-tuned for binary classification with augmentation. The goal is to provide a solid baseline with AUROC â‰¥ 0.85 for reliable lesion diagnosis.
